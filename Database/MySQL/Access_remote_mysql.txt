Give permission to access from different ip:

    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Then comment out the below line in file "/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf" (is required!):

    bind-address = 127.0.0.1 

    $ sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

If it need then restart mysql:
    
    $ sudo service mysql restart
