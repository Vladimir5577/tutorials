Install:

	$ sudo apt install mysql-server

	To get inside:
		$ sudo mysql

		Check the method auth:
			> SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
			We can see auth method --- auth-socket
			We need to change it to ---  caching_sha2_password

			> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'password';
			or to --- mysql_native_password --- better
			> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

			After:
				> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

			Then exit:
				> exit;

Enter to database with new credentials:

	$ mysql -u root -ppassword
	
	Create a new user:
	-----------------

		> CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
		
		Give all priveleges:

		> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

		> exit;

Enter to db with new user:
--------------------------

	$ mysql -u user -ppassword

// ===============================================

Check status:

	$ systemctl status mysql.service

If it is not working then tun it:

	$ sudo systemctl start mysql
